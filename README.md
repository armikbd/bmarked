##Features of this theme:
1. Fixed width
2. Simple layout
3. IE8+ Support
4. Includes less (css preprocessor) files. So you can customize the theme easily by setting your own variables.


For RGBA background support in IE8 I used [this] 
(http://lea.verou.me/2009/02/bulletproof-cross-browser-rgba-backgrounds/) solution.
There is an empty folder named 'colors' inside 'ie8' folder. This folder is necessary.
png images generated by rgba.php will be placed into that folder.
